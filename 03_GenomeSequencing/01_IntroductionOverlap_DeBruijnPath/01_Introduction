## Be careful , if code didn't work, it is because the files were moved into a 'directory' 01_IntroductionOverlap_DeBruijnPath

Related to Cunn... bridges problem (each bridge 'short read' must be visited 'read' only once)

## The String reconstruction
Reads are not known to what strand they belong to. In addition, there is sequencing errors in the reads. Moreover, some regions of the genome may not be read.
all reads are of the same length, hence they are k-mers of a certain k length. Hence the first concept to understand is the composition of such k-mers into a string. 

Consecutive k-mers are linked together to form a genome path. One new symbol is added to the genome at each new k-mer.
A string's genome path is possible to be constructed from its k-mer composition. The suffix of a pattern in the genome path should equal the prefix of the next pattern in the genome path. The suffix is the last k-1 nucleotides of the k-mer, while the prefix is the first k-1 nucleotides of the k-mer. 
A k-mer can be considered as a node in a directed graph, where the edges of such graph are between nodes where the suffix of the first is equal to prefix of the second node. Such graph on these k-mers is called the overlap graph.    

A Hamiltonipath is a path in the overlap graph where every node is visited once.

Instead of having the k-mers as node in the overlap graph. We can represent them as edges and the nodes will be the common k-1 nucleotides between two edges. The resulting graph is called De Bruijn.

Eulerian path is a path in De Bruijn graph where every edge is visited exactly once.

A composition Graph represents a composition of a sequence string using an isolated directed edge.
