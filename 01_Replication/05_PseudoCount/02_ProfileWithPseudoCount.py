## Now that you have written a function CountWithPseudocounts(Motifs),
# write a function ProfileWithPseudocounts(Motifs) that takes a list of strings Motifs as input
# and returns the profile matrix of Motifs with pseudocounts as a dictionary of lists.
# Then add this function to Motifs.py. Make sure to use CountWithPseudocounts(Motifs) as a subroutine!


# Input:  A set of kmers Motifs
# Output: ProfileWithPseudocounts(Motifs)
def ProfileWithPseudocounts(Motifs):
    t = len(Motifs)
    k = len(Motifs[0])
    profile = {}
    # insert your code here
    count = CountWithPseudocounts(Motifs)
    for symbol in 'ACGT':
        profile[symbol] = []

    for i in range(k):
        sum = 0
        for symbol in 'ACGT':
            sum = sum + count[symbol][i]

        for symbol in 'ACGT':
            profile[symbol].append(count[symbol][i] / sum)

    return profile
